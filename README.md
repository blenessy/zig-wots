Zig Tutorial: Wienernitz One Time Signature
===========================================

I am a very experience and proffessional coder (Python, Julia, Java, C/C++, etc.).
I managed to implement the [W-OTS](https://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/w-otss-the-problem-sleepwalking-into-a-broken-world-of-trust-7a6e027d1d9f) primitives
in 8h time, without knowing any Zig before.

This project demostrates how easy it is to write low-level (Zig 0.7.1) code, which is:

- safe
- correct
- readable
- fast
- small
- portable
